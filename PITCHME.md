## `D3 <> React`
#### Optimizing for Developer Experience (DX) and Performance

---

### What is DX?

DX is defined by _robust functionality_ that delivers _stability_, _usability_, and _clarity_

+++

* Functionality
  * The feature layer. "What does the thing do?". Functionality can be anywhere from a tiny helper function to an enormous framework. 
  * ex: cross-platform console colors with `Chalk`, or a new approach to writing front-end code through `TypeScript`

+++

* Stability
  * How reliable are the features? How often do unpredictable bugs surface?
  * ex: `AWS EC2` with 99.99% uptime, or `Lodash` with 100% predictable functionality.

+++

* Usability
  * Does it play nice with other tools? What is the performance impact of using it? How long does it take to set up?
  * ex: Time to make a `TodoMVC` in `Angular` vs `React` vs `JQuery`, or the amount of time spent looking up documentation vs the amount of time spent developing.
 
+++ 
 
* Clarity
  * Does it make sense? Do I understand why it exists, and can I explain it? Does it follow common conventions? What are the costs associated with using this tool?
  * Ex: How difficult it is to describe `Redux` compared to `RxJS`, or the predictability of compiled `CoffeeScript` syntax 

---

### `D3`

D3 is: 

* a *visualization* toolkit for creating _data-driven documents_
* most often used for making charts, but is not explicitly a charting library
* declarative, providing reliable wrappers for clunky SVG syntax and DOM methods.

D3 emphasizes "efficient manipulation of documents based on data".

+++

#### Raw HTML
```html
  <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="200" y2="200"/>
```

#### D3
```javascript
d3.svg.line()
  .x((d) => (d.x))
  .y((d) => (d.y));
```

---

### `React`

`React` is "a JavaScript library for building user interfaces", often referred to as the 'V' in MVC.

More specifically, it is: 
* a framework for creating modular and encapsulated components, composed together for complex UIs
* declarative, with components held together by thin `render` loops and component lifecycle methods

+++

#### React
```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

const Component = (
  <h1>
    {greet('friends')}
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  Component,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

```html
<h1>
  Hello, friends!
</h1>
```
