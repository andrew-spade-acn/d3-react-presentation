### Optimizing for Developer Experience (DX) and Performance

---

### What is DX?

DX is defined by _robust functionality_ that delivers _stability_, _usability_, and _clarity_

+++

* Functionality
  * The feature layer. "What does the thing do?". Functionality can be anywhere from a tiny helper function to an enormous framework. 
  * ex: cross-platform console colors with `Chalk`, or a new approach to writing front-end code through `TypeScript`

+++

* Stability
  * How reliable are the features? 
  * ex: `AWS EC2` with 99.99% uptime, or `Lodash` with 100% predictable functionality.

+++

* Usability
  * Does it play nice with other tools? What is the performance impact of using it? How long does it take to set up? How often do I feel like I'm fighting with the tool?
  * ex: Time to write a `TodoMVC` in `Angular` vs `React` vs `Vue` vs `JQuery`, or the amount of time spent looking up documentation vs the amount of time spent developing (`webpack` has a notable reputation for failing here).
 
+++ 
 
* Clarity
  * Does it make intuitive sense? Do I understand why it exists, and can I explain it to somebody? Does it follow common conventions? What are the costs associated with using this tool?
  * Ex: How difficult it is to describe `Redux` compared to `RxJS`, or the predictability of `TypeScript` syntax 
  * Food for thought: does compiled code come with a cost to clarity?
